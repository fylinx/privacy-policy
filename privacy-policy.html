<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the <em>Fylinx: Merge Five Tiles</em> app (hereby referred to as the “Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Fylinx Game (hereby referred to as the “Service Provider”) as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use “AS IS”.</p>
